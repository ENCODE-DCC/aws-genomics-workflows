# Genomics Workflows on AWS - CDK code

Contained herein is a CDK application for creating AWS resources for working with large-scale biomedical data - e.g. genomics.  

In order to deploy this CDK application, you'll need an environment with AWS CLI access and AWS CDK installed. A quick 
way yo get an environment for running this application is to launch [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/).  

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code 
with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential 
tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install 
files or configure your development machine to start new projects.


## Download

Clone the repo to your local environment / Cloud9 environment.
```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-genomics-workflows.git
```

## Configure

This CDK application requires an S3 bucket and a VPC. The application can create them as part of the deployment or 
you could configure the application to use your own S3 bucket and/or existing VPC.

After cloning the repo, open, update, and save the application configuration file - `app.config.json`.

**accountID** - Your [AWS account id](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html).  
**region** - The [AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) 
you want to use for the deployment (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-2, etc.).
**S3.existingBucket** - If you want to use an existing bucket, set this value to true, otherwise set it to false to 
create a new bucket.  
**S3.bucketName** - The bucket name to use or create.  
**VPC.createVPC** - If you want to create a new VPC, set this to true, otherwise set to false.  
**VPC.existingVPCName** - If you set the createVPC option to false, you must provide a valid VPC name to use in the 
same region of the deployment.  
**VPC.maxAZs** - The amount of availability zones to use when creating a new VPC.  
**VPC.cidr** - The [CIDR block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) for the new VPC.  
**VPC.cidrMask** - The [CIDR block subnet mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#Subnet_masks) 
for the new VPC.  
**batch.defaultVolumeSize** - The default EBS volume size in GiB to be attached to the EC2 instance under AWS Batch.  
**batch.spotMaxVCPUs** - The limit on vcpus when using [spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/).  
**batch.onDemendMaxVCPUs** - The limit on vcpus when using on-demand instances.  
**batch.instanceTypes** - The [EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) to use in AWS Batch.  
**stepFunctions.launchDemoPipeline** - If set to true, the application will deploy a demo pipeline using step fuinctions.  
**stepFunctions.jobDefinitions** - List of parametrs for the demo application bioinformatics tools.

## Deploy

To deploy the CDK application, use the command line and make sure you are in the root folder of the CDK application. 
(`src/aws-genomics-cdk`).  
First install the neccessary node.js modules
```
npm install
```

Then deploy the application.
```
# The "--require-approval never" parameter will skip the question to approve specific resouce creation, 
# such as IAM roles. You can remove this parameter if you want to be prompted to approve creating these 
# resources.
cdk deploy --all --require-approval never
```
